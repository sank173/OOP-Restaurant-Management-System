# OOP Restaurant Management System

## Project Overview

This project is a basic simulation of a restaurant management system developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java. It includes core features like handling reservations, processing orders, and coordinating kitchen operations. The system is built to demonstrate the design of classes and objects, focusing on structure rather than full functionality.

## Features

- **Reservation Management**: Basic reservation system to manage table bookings.
- **Order Processing**: Simulates the process of taking and processing customer orders.
- **Kitchen Coordination**: Coordinates between order processing and the kitchen.

## Project Structure

The project consists of multiple Java classes that represent the different components of the restaurant management system. The classes and their interactions are designed based on a predefined class diagram.

### Files
- `Reservation.java`: Handles table reservations.
- `Order.java`: Manages customer orders.
- `Menu.java`: Represents the menu of the restaurant.
- `Kitchen.java`: Coordinates food preparation.
- Other files implementing additional restaurant functionalities.

(Note: Each Java file contains method signatures and class structures, but the methods themselves are not fully implemented.)

## How to Run
